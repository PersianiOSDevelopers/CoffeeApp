# Coffee App
This project is a fun cafe app. we all love coffee ü§òüèª

## Architecture
The main architecture of the project is MVVM-Coordinator but in every project and context I would think what is the best solution, I try to use repositories, DI and create abstractions to achieve better testability and more clean and scaleable code

## Unit-Tests
As you can see I tried to write unit tests for different components but unfortunately test coverage is not high. 

## third-party libraries
I just used Simplecheckbox for drawing checkbox and I installed it with SPM
