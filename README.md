# CoffeeIT Code Challenge
This project is a fun demonstration of my skills in a cafe app. we all love coffee 🤘🏻

## Architecture
The main architecture of the project is MVVM-Coordinator but in every project and context I would think what is the best solution, I try to use repositories, DI and create abstractions to achieve better testability and more clean and scaleable code

## Unit-Tests
As you can see I tried to write unit tests for different components but unfortunately test coverage is not high. I try to show my testing skills in different components

## third-party libraries
I just used Simplecheckbox for drawing checkbox and I installed it with SPM

## Conclusion
Thank you so much for reviewing my code. I really appreciated any suggestion you have regarding code and implementation and overall it was a fun journey 🤝  Hope we work together on awesome projects 😅
